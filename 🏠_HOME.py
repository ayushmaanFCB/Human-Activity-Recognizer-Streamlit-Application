        <p style="text-align:justify; font-size:18px">The technique of identifying and interpreting distinct human actions and behaviours utilising cutting-edge technology like computer vision and machine learning is known as human activity detection. There are several uses for this technology, including smart homes, surveillance and security systems, and healthcare monitoring. The system can identify and classify actions like walking, running, sitting, gesturing, or even more complicated activities like cooking or playing sports by analysing visual or sensor data, such as video feeds or motion sensors. In many areas, safety, effectiveness, and convenience are significantly improved by human activity detection, and this technology's continued advancement holds the possibility of revolutionising how humans interact with technology and the outside world.</p>
